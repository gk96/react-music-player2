# Fork Notes

- Updated all dependencies
- Stripped it down to just the essential features (removed toFile, transform, etc. since you can do those yourself)
- Rewrote all of the streaming behavior
- Fixed issues with handling errors
- Promises to be responsive to PRs

All thanks and credit to the original author.

## Usage

Use [got](https://www.npmjs.com/package/got) to make an HTTP request with automatic retries for network errors.

Designed for downloading large files. If transfer fails part-way through, will retry, resuming from point where previous attempt finished, using HTTP range headers.

### gotResume( [url], [options] ) -> Stream

```js
const stream = gotResume('http://google.com/')
stream.pipe(fs.createWriteStream('foo.html'))

stream.on('error', err => console.log('Failed!'))
stream.on('end', () => console.log('Finished!'))
```

### Options

#### url

Alternative way to provide URL.

```js
const stream = gotResume({ url: 'http://google.com/' })
```

#### attempts

Max number of attempts in a row yielding no data (i.e. failed connection, empty response) before aborting.

Set to `0` for no limit. Default `10`.

```js
const stream = gotResume('http://google.com/', { attempts: 0 })
```

#### attemptsTotal

Max number of total attempts before aborting.

Set to `0` for no limit. Default `0`.

#### backoff

Function to determine wait in milliseconds before retry. Called with arguments `(attempt, transfer)`.

`attempt` is what attempt number for current chunk (reset to zero when a new chunk is successfully received).

`transfer` is the internal `Transfer` object (see below).

If function returns `false`, the transfer is cancelled. If using this mechanism, `options.attempts` should be set to `0` so it does not interfere.

If not provided, default backoff function starts with 1000ms and doubles each time:

```js
function backoff(attempt) {
  return Math.pow(2, attempt - 1) * 1000
}
```

#### length

Length of response expected in bytes. If undefined, `length` will be determined from HTTP `content-length` header.

If server does not provide `content-length` header, and `options.length` is not set, transfer will be considered complete when first successful request completes.

If `options.length` is set, only that number of bytes will be fetched (i.e. file will be truncated).

#### needLength

Set to true if you require the length of the transfer to be retrieved at start of the transfer. Default: false

Explanation: By default got will use transfer encoding (e.g. gzip). This makes the `content-length` HTTP header unreliable. Setting `options.needLength` disables encoding so length should be retrieved accurately (if server provides it).

#### pre

An async function that is run before each chunk request. Must return a `Promise`. Request will commence once promise resolves.

Useful where some authentication requires being set up before the transfer HTTP request, or where resource has a different URL each time (e.g. some file transfer services).

`pre` function is called with `Transfer` object (see below). To set URL for next chunk, `pre` should set `transfer.url`. To alter `got` options, should set `transfer.gotOptions`.

```js
function pre(transfer) {
  transfer.gotOptions.headers['user-agent'] = 'Stealth 2.0'
  return Promise.resolve()
}
```

#### log

Function to receive logging information e.g. HTTP responses.

```js
const stream = gotResume('http://google.com/', { log: console.log })
```

#### got

Options to pass to `got`. See [got documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/got) for details.

```js
const stream = gotResume('http://google.com/', { got: { method: 'POST' } })
```

### Events

#### error

Emitted with a `gotResume.TransferError` on stream when transfer fails and has exhausted retries.

#### end

Emitted when transfer completes.

NB Is also emitted after `error` event if transfer fails.

#### progress

Emitted when data received. Emitted with progress object of form `{transferred: 100, total: 3000}`.

#### request

Emitted with HTTP request object when first HTTP request made to server.

NB Not emitted again for each retry HTTP request. You cannot abort the transfer with `request.abort()` as the request may be finished if a retry has happened.

#### response

Emitted when first successful HTTP response is received. NB Not emitted again for each retry HTTP request.

Useful for e.g. determining length of transfer:

```js
const stream = gotResume('http://google.com/')
stream.on('response', res => console.log('Length: ', stream.transfer.length))
```

### Cancellation

The stream returned by `gotStream()` has an additional method `.cancel()`. Calling `.cancel()` will abort the transfer and cause the stream to emit an `error` event with a `gotResume.CancelError`.

If the transfer is complete before `.cancel()` is called, no `error` event will be emitted.

If `options.pre` function is supplied and `.cancel()` is called while `options.pre` is running, `.cancel()` method on the promise returned by `options.pre` will be called if it exists. Otherwise the transfer will abort once the promise resolves.

### Transfer object

A transfer in progress is represented internally as an instance of `gotResume.Transfer` class.

Transfer object is stored as `stream.transfer` and also passed to `options.pre` function.

## Tests

Use `npm test` to run the tests. Use `npm run cover` to check coverage.

Few tests so far but seems to work fine!
